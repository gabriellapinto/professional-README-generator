# professional-README-generator

## About this Project
The purpose of this project was to create a professional README generator to create a README.md file generated from the user's input. To invoke this application, the user would open the command line inside the project and type 'node index.js'. The user is then met with several questions about their contact information and their project. Once the user is finished answering all questions, they are then met with a professional quality README.md file that was generated from their responses!
